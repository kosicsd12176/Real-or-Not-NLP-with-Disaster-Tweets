# Real-or-Not-NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets Kaggle
Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not

Competition Description

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.

What am I predicting?

You are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0
